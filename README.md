 Move the tabs on left/right一handside to a new window (contains the current tab) 

## Credits

* This workflow is inspired by the safari extension [yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space](https://github.com/yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space) and @gingerbreadman’s suggestion ([Tab-Space's issue 39](https://github.com/yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space/issues/39)).

* The icon is from [Open Tabs Icon #296010](https://icon-library.com/icon/open-tabs-icon-19.html).
